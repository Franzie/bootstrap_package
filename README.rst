Bootstrap package for TYPO3 CMS
===============================

.. No public website so far. Let see if it can be re-activated.
.. Check it out the live example running at http://bootstrap.typo3cms.demo.typo3.org/. The package is provided in the demo area of typo3 meaning it is
.. possible to log in the BE and play around. The demo is reset every three hours as information.
.. Head to http://bootstrap.typo3cms.demo.typo3.org/typo3 and log-in with "admin" "password" as credentials.

Motivation
----------

All started with the modernisation of our Dummy package we were using in our company. To give a bit of background, we were aiming to:

* Have Twitter Bootstrap as HTML / CSS Framework
* Use as much as possible Fluid for the rendering and the templating. Actually, it turned out we have reached the 100% thanks to the work of Claus Due
* Keep folder fileadmin clean from TS / JS / CSS files which should be for storing media only (images, documents etcâ€¦)

We wanted not only a package to demonstrate the capability of TYPO3 but also something useful so that it should save us from the tedious and repeating work when kick-starting a website. The result is pretty much promising. More important we **have put everything in public** so that you can test and also take advantage for your own needs.

How to install?
===============

There are two options, either you can get the **stable version** from http://get.typo3.org/bootstrap or you can follow this
little step by step tutorial to get the **master version** - in no time to talk the marketing guy :) Notice the
`system requirement`_ before proceeding and make sure PHP 5.3.7 - 5.4.x and MariaDB / MySQL 5.1.x-5.5.x is installed in your
system::

	# Clone the repository
	git clone --recursive git://github.com/Ecodev/bootstrap_package.git

	# Download TYPO3 CMS Core
	cd bootstrap_package/htdocs
	wget get.typo3.org/current -O typo3_src-latest.tgz

	# Extract TYPO3 CMS Core archive and symlink
	tar -xzf typo3_src-latest.tgz
	rm typo3_src-latest.tgz
	ln -s typo3_src-* typo3_src

	# Manual steps
	-> configure a Virtual Host. Convenience example for Apache:

		<VirtualHost *:80>
		    DocumentRoot "/var/vhosts/example.fab/htdocs"
		    ServerName example.fab
		    ServerAlias *.example.fab
		    ErrorLog "/var/vhosts/example.fab/logs/error_log"
		    CustomLog "/var/vhosts/example.fab/logs/access_log" common
		</VirtualHost>

	-> add a DNS entry (e.g editing /etc/hosts file)
	-> open in the browser http://example.com and run the 1,2,3 wizard


Notice the ``htdocs`` folder located at the root of the direction is not mandatory. It just matches our hosting convention in our company.
If you want to get rid of it, rename the file structure to your convenience when configuring the Virtual Host.

Support
=======

Bugs and wishes can be reported on the `bug tracker`_. You can also take advantage of some commercial support related to the Bootstrap Package by contacting contact@ecodev.ch.

Phing build
===========

`Phing`_: is a build system for PHP and is used to replicate the website between production and development and do some low level tasks.
Also make sure to have a look at the `Frontend Development Workflow`_ which integrates itself with this build system
Some instructions how to get started with this development workflow::

	# Head to the home
	cd bootstrap_package

	# Installation of Composer is not already done
	curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

	# Optional: install it globally. You may need to reload your terminal.
	mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

	# Install dependencies
	# If Composer is installed globally "composer install" is enought
	# This will basically installed Phing locally for this website.
	php composer.phar install

	./bin/phing
	-> read carefully instruction. A file must be generated in `configuration`.

	./bin/phing help

	[echo] ---------------------------------------------
	[echo] Handle cache
	[echo] ---------------------------------------------
	[echo] phing clear_cache     - Flush cached files along with database cache (depth 3)
	[echo] phing warmup          - Call Frontend to generate necessary files
	[echo]
	[echo] phing c               - Clear cache, depth 1: typo3temp/Cache files
	[echo] phing cc              - Clear cache, depth 2: all typo3temp files
	[echo] phing ccc             - Clear cache, depth 3: all typo3temp files + database
	[echo]

	[echo] Import website locally
	[echo] ---------------------------------------------
	[echo] phing show            - Show Phing current configuration
	[echo] phing import-dump     - Fetch the database and build it again locally for TYPO3 6.0
	[echo] phing htaccess        - Fetch the htaccess from the remote server
	[echo] phing symlink         - Create symlinks to the core, current value "/t3core/typo3_src-6.1"
	[echo] phing uploads         - Fetch uploads folder
	[echo] phing fileadmin       - Fetch fileadmin
	[echo] phing user_upload     - Fetch user_upload folder

	[echo] phing d               - import-dump
	[echo] phing initialize6     - import-dump, htaccess, symlink, uploads, fileadmin
	[echo] phing reset           - import-dump, clear_cache, warmup

How to continue?
================

As a next step, you likely want to change the CSS, add some custom layouts or customize configuration.
The place to head to is ``EXT:speciality`` which is located at ``htdocs/typo3conf/ext/speciality``. The name "speciality"
is just the extension key we are using in our company as convention. We keep it across our projects so that we don't have to think more
where to find the source code. This is not a big deal to change the name in case. However, the extension is mandatory and contains:

* HTML templates - ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Private/``
* Public resources such as JavaScript and CSS files  - ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Public/``
* PHP Code - ``EXT:speciality/Classes/``

Adding a new layout
-------------------

As a short tutorial, let assume one needs to add a 4 column layout in the website. Proceed as follows:

* Copy ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Private/Templates/Page/3Columns.html`` to ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Private/Templates/Page/4Columns.html``
* Update section "Content" and "Configuration" in ``speciality/Resources/Private/Templates/Page/4Columns.html``

You have a new layout to be used in BE / FE! So quick? You don't believe me, do you?

As further reading, I recommend the `excellent work / documentation`_ from `@NamelessCoder`_ which framework is used in the Bootstrap package, sponsored by `Wildside`_  and its motivation. Also, I recommend having at look `fluidpages_bootstrap`_ which definitely contains more advance examples for page layouts.

Static TypoScript template
--------------------------

Static configuration files are usually managed and stored in the database. To be more precise, they can be added in the BE
from a Template record (AKA ``sys_template``) in tab "Includes".
However, we are using Git for managing our entire website and we want to have this configurable at the source code level.
We are managing our configuration in file `EXT:speciality/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.ts`. Have a look there if you must add additional
configuration.

If you are facing problem, you may consider the Hook approach for managing your Static TypoScript template. More detail in this `blog post`_.

Tip for development
-------------------

* TYPO3 has many levels of caches. While it is good for performance, it will become very annoying in development mode. Check out the `uncache extension`_ to work around.
* For new TYPO3 developers which are starting with extension development take advantage of the `extension builder`_.

Behavior-driven development
===========================

The main purpose of `behavior-driven development`_ (abbreviated BDD) is to ensure the feature set is there taking
the point of view of a User (largely speaking). It is also referred as
"Acceptance tests". Acceptance criteria should be written in terms of scenarios and implemented as classes:
Given [initial context], when [event occurs], then [ensure some outcomes].

See it in practice::

	cd tests

	curl http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar install

	./bin/behat

Feature tests files are to be found into ``tests/features``.
